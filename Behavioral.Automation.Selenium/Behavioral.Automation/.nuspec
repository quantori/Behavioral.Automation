        <description>
            Platform design is based on strong and well-defined borderline between procedural test cases 
            structure and object-oriented code-behind.

            We think that test cases implementation approach (inside BDD paradigm) is literaly the same 
            across different applications. That means that we can define and reuse grammar structures across 
            different application domains. On top of this, while talking about single page web applications, 
            we may take into account that atomic controls behavior is also the same across different domains.

            The whole automation code is divided into the following parts:
            - Feature files
            - Bindings
            - Wrappers
            - Infrastructure bindings
            - UI structure descriptive code
            - Supportive code
